A [Digital Public Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_public_goods) (DPG) is an free and open source software, platform, data set, or other digital tool designed to address social challenges and promote the public good. DPGs are accessible to everyone, promote inclusivity, and aim to advance the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To be classified as a DPG, a digital solution must be open, ethically created, and have a broad potential for positive social impact, such as improving healthcare, education, governance, or environmental sustainability.

The [Digital Public Good Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net) mantains a registry of the solutions officially recognized as DPG: https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/
